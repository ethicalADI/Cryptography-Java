# Cryptography-Java

Cryptography project : The project is based on a cryptography technique that uses Double layer encryption and decryption using Armstrong numbers and RGB color-based mappings for various types of file format. The idea is inspired from [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5738822) research paper. 
#
Various modifications, like use of mathematical formulae for increasing the time efficiency for traversal of matrices, are applied to the ideas presented in the paper
#
## A java Program that enables Double layer encryption and decryption of data using Armstrong Numbers and RGB color model for various types of file format.
